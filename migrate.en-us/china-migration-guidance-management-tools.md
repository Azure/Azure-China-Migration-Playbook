# Migrate Media Resources

This section contains information that you may find helpful as you migrate Azure media resources across Azure regions.

## Media Services

In Azure Media Services, you configure your own storage account and all media assets. First, create a new Media Services account in the target Azure regions. Then, reload the corresponding media artifacts and complete encoding and streaming under the new Media Services account.
